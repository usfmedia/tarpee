Welcome to this prayer.... These Indigenous structures were endearingly named Tarpees by members of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe. 

The Tarpee came through prayer after visiting Standing Rock for the Seattle to Standing Rock canoe journey in September 2016. The nights were cold and I knew our Indigenous elders would still be sleeping in vehicles and tents, so I prayed about a way to help our elders make it through the winter safely. I started thinking about building cabins, but I realized they would be very expensive and slow to build. I thought about Teepees, which are beautiful Indigenous structures, but I recognized how expensive they also are. None of those options would house enough of our elders, so I prayed about it more and started drawing. I drew a rooftop with metal brackets and poles attached... and the first generation Tarpee was born! 

I put the first one up in my driveway in Redmond, Washington on our Coast Salish Lands. From there, I did some fundraising and put together a team to build Tarpees. At Standing Rock we gifted 48 double-insulated Tarpees to Indigenous families with elders staying through the winter. We also supplied modified barrel stoves for each Tarpee. They were so hot and efficient, we called them Tarpee heater bombs! People who stayed in them during the blizzards were quoted as saying, “I was in a blizzard in my underwear in a Tarpee." Some people had grass growing inside them despite -20° blizzards. 

To date, we have had three generations of Tarpee designs. We have utilized and gifted 76 of them nationally and internationally to stop fossil fuel expansion and to help bring this world back into peace, balance and harmony. We ask people to follow protocol and contact us if they want to build these for any given situation. 

Tarpee design is the intellectual property of Paul Chiyokten Wagner, founder of Protectors of the Salish Sea.
