**ABOUT**

The tarpee is an Indigenous-led design adaptation of a conical tent structure for use as an emergency shelter. _We are still in design development and have not yet released a public version of this project._ 

- "Fabrication" folder contains links to assembly instructions, videos, and diagrams.
- "Files" folder contains cut and design files for metal parts.

Please reach out to hello_john@protonmail.com with any questions or concerns.

**OVERVIEW**

Invented at Standing Rock by Paul Chiyokten Wagner (Saanich First Nations) during NoDAPL protests,<sup>1</sup> the tarpee is a conical tent structure inspired by tipis and similar traditional structures for deployment as an emergency shelter. The tarpees proved themselves to be an invaluable and life saving shelter for Indigenous and allied water protectors living through the winter at Standing Rock, and have appeared at environmental protests since Standing Rock and been deployed as emergency housing in the United States. 

This version (Tarpee/lasercut v.1.0 beta) is an open source version of the tarpee that can speed its availability and construction. To this end, we have created a design file of the mounting top assembly that can be lasercut locally, improving access to a key structural piece of the tarpee. This version includes a few additional design refinements, including a method for cutting and wrapping the exterior tarp shell. We also have protocols for appropriate use that will guide the tarpees’ distribution. Note: there exist other forks of the tarpee project created by Paul and others.


**CREDIT HISTORY**

* The current tarpee/lasercut v.1.0 beta (imperial) was designed by Sebastian Müllauer and John Kim @ the Funkinsitut community in Kolberg, Germany 2022-2023.
* A prototype for tarpee/lasercut v.1.0 beta was designed by Paul Chiyokten Wagner, Molly Reichert, and John Kim as the final project for “Structures of Resistance Studio”, a year 4 BArch studio at Dunwoody College of Technology in Spring 2022.
* Tarpee/3Dprint (pre-alpha). A 3D printed thermoplastic version of the tarpee mounting top assembly was developed in 2021-2022 by Sebastian Müllauer and John Kim. For a variety of reasons, developers transitioned to the current lasercut version. More information about this build is available upon request.
* Invented by Paul Chiyokten Wagner (2016-2017).

**APPRPOPRIATE USE**

* Please read Paul Chiyokten Wagner’s [cultural history letter](https://github.com/usfmedia/tarpee/blob/main/cultural_history_letter.md) about the appropriate use of the tarpee.
* We continue to work on defining appropriate uses of the tarpee. These are subject to change. A few protocols regarding the appropriate use of a tarpee:
  * Though not a tipi, the tarpee draws inspiration from conical tent structures that are sacred to communities around the world. The tarpee recognizes and honors this cultural heritage.
  * Tarpees were designed for environmental and social actions in settings with Indigenous leadership and/or movements that foreground Indigenous beliefs, ideas and/or practices.
* We encourage the use of tarpees in situations that fit this protocol. If you have any questions about your particular deployment, you’re welcome to contact us to talk about the appropriateness of a tarpee.
